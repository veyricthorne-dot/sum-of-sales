# Sales Summary Web App

## Overview
This single-page web app loads predefined CSV data representing sales transactions, computes the total sales amount, updates the page title dynamically with a random seed, and displays the total inside a styled `<div>`.

## Setup
No external setup required. The CSV data is embedded directly in the script within the HTML.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the sales total displayed with a dynamic title.

## Improvements made in this version
- Embed CSV data within the script to simulate fetching.
- Dynamically generate a seed for the title.
- Style the total sales inside a Bootstrap card for visual clarity.
- Use straightforward parsing and summation methods to ensure accuracy and simplicity.
